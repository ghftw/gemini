Gemini augmentations

Building on the translator I wrote for the chainlink augmentations, I added a reverse engineering function for pages already translated by Google/Chrome.

As you can see in the translations directory, there is one for every language Google translates into.

This functionality can serve two obvious purposes: 

  1. provide the translations to site owners as a service
  2. build up a massive offline translation dictionary

However, the project is not finished and on pause for now.

It is simply a proof of concept for reverse engineering browser based translations.
